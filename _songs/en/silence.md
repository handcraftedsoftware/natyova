[Chorus]
I’ve never seen such lonely eyes,
Not in anyone before.
I’ve never heard such hurting lines,
From any heart I’ve known.

[Verse 1]
Now there’s silence deep in me,
And I just want to stay still.
Wish that I could teach you dreams,
And the strength to make them real.
I can’t believe the words you say,
When your sad eyes look my way.
I hear your voice, but can’t accept —
Your love belongs to someone else.

[Chorus]
I’ve never seen such lonely eyes,
Not in anyone before.
I’ve never heard such hurting lines,
From any heart I’ve known.

[Verse 2]
It doesn’t matter how or when,
I just don’t know why it’s so.
I’m the only one still holding on,
And I can’t let you go.

[Chorus]
I’ve never seen such lonely eyes,
Not in anyone before.
I’ve never heard such hurting lines,
From any heart I’ve known.
