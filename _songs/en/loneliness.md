[Verse 1]
In the dark empty spaces
There are no people faces
Only stars and galaxies
Only beautiful shine
This is terrible feeling
Empty dreams, nothing to believe in
I'm alone in this place
And I'm missing you, babe

[Chorus]
Loneliness, it is my trouble
Loneliness, it's all around
Loneliness, until the end
Loneliness, loneliness

[Verse 2]
No one knows where is up or down,
The Earth just floats — no sky, no ground.
How long can we live, and still not see,
What the meaning of life could be?

[Chorus]
Loneliness, it is my trouble
Loneliness, it's all around
Loneliness, until the end
Loneliness, loneliness

[Verse 3]
Look at the forests, the deep blue seas,
Feel how your soul aligns with me.
We’re just a shimmer, a fleeting wave,
In the noise the cosmos gave.

[Chorus]
Loneliness, it is my trouble
Loneliness, it's all around
Loneliness, until the end
Loneliness, loneliness
