[Verse 1]
This evening there’s only rain outside,
Not at yours, and we’re not side by side.
Sometimes it’s hard, I can’t deny,
To play these grown-up games of life.

[Chorus]
I could turn your every dream
Into something real, it seems,
But there’s no reason to.
I could turn your world around,
If I just tried to pull you down —
Maybe not for long… but true.

[Verse 2]
I once knew how to fly so high,
Now I’m standing still on the ground.
I once knew how to dream,
But it doesn’t matter now somehow.
I would tell you how much I love you,
But okay — I’ll keep it silent too.

[Verse 3]
This evening there’s only rain outside,
Not at yours, and we’re not side by side.
Sometimes it’s hard, I can’t deny,
To play these grown-up games of life.

[Chorus]
I could turn your every dream
Into something real, it seems,
But there’s no reason to.
I could turn your world around,
If I just tried to pull you down —
Maybe not for long… but true.
