[Verse 1]
I’m your nightmare, you’re my curse,
In red I’ll dance this Halloween.
No, I won’t fall into your arms,
No matter how your voice may plead.

[Verse 2]
You’ll never steal that fleeting kiss
From lips of pride, of scarlet hue.
And once again I fade to mist,
Leaving love’s last breath with you.

[Verse 3]
I’m your nightmare, you’re my curse,
In red I’ll dance this Halloween.
No, I won’t fall into your arms,
No matter how your voice may plead.
