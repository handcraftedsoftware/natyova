[Verse 1]
He went away to forget, but remembered much more,
He tried to let it go, but he’s holding on harder than before.
He wanted to run, to unlove without pain,
But he fell even deeper — she became his home again.

[Chorus]
Where do our roads now lead, tell me where?
What cities will I see, when you’re not there?
When will I look in your eyes, not in photos — for real?
When will I hold you, when will I feel your kiss again?

[Verse 2]
Ahead lies autumn, and the winter’s chill,
Work’s still a struggle — it always will.
I’ll try to remember, then let you go free,
You can see it yourself — we’re not meant to be.

[Chorus]
Where do our roads now lead, tell me where?
What cities will I see, when you’re not there?
When will I look in your eyes, not in photos — for real?
When will I hold you, when will I feel your kiss again?
